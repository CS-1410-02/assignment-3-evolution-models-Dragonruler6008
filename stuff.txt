You create a simulation which rolls for a series of 
different attributes in your classes that ultimately 
contribute to an agent's success or failure and can 
be affected by other classes' attributes. 
For Example: You create a creature that has a 10 
percent chance of finding food which will update the 
creature's hunger. Additionally your success or lack 
of success in finding food updates how much food there 
is in the world and may increase scarcity and more 
competitiveness.
